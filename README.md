# Time Series Animations

Animations of Time Series Data (Bar Chart & Line Graph) Using Matplotlib.

I've completed a Python project analyzing global population data from the United Nations World Population Prospects, using time series analysis to create an animated bar chart of the top 10 most populous countries. üó∫Ô∏èüìä

Key Skills Gained:
- Time Series Analysis: Analyzed and processed population data over multiple years.
- Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed data with pandas.
- Visualization & Animation: Created smooth animations with Matplotlib and saved as a GIF and video.
- Version Control: Managed the project on GitHub.

If you want the video or GIF to be part of the repository, follow these steps:

- Add the video or GIF file to your repository (e.g., media/demo.mp4).
- Reference it in the README using a relative path:
